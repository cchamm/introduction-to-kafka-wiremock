# Introduction to Kafka with Spring Boot - Standalone Wiremock

This repository contains the code to support the [Introduction to Kafka with Spring Boot](https://github.com/lydtechconsulting/introduction-to-kafka-wiremock.git) online course, for the standalone Wiremock portion of the course.

The associated repository for the Dispatch Service can be found here:  [Dispatch Service Repository](https://github.com/lydtechconsulting/introduction-to-kafka-with-spring-boot)

This project contains a standalone Wiremock implementation that represents a third-party Stock Service which is called by the Dispatch Service and used to trigger retry scenarios.

Plenty of useful information about your Introduction to Kafka with Spring Boot course can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/lydtechconsulting/introduction-to-kafka-with-spring-boot/wiki).

## Stock Service API

The API call is in the following format:

```
GET /api/stock?item=myItem
```

The wiremock is primed to return the following responses:

- `400` - if the item ends with the string `_400` e.g. `GET /api/stock?item=myItem_400`
- `500` - if the item ends with the string `_500`
- `502` - if the item ends with the string `_502` fail the first call then succeed. This allows for retry testing.
- `200` - for all other items

## Run the Wiremock

First download the Wiremock standalone jar file using the instructions found here:
https://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/

Copy the jar to this project directory.

Run the Wiremock by using the following command (replacing wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.35.0.jar with the name of the downloaded jar file): 
```
java -jar wiremock-standalone-3.3.1.jar --port 9001
```

The service will start on port `9001`, which is where the Dispatch Service will attempt to call it.

## Run the Wiremock using Docker
```shell
./run.sh
```
